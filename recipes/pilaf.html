    <p>Pilaf (US spelling) or pilau (UK spelling) is a rice dish, or in some regions, a wheat dish, whose recipe usually involves cooking in stock or broth, adding spices, and other ingredients such as vegetables or meat,and employing some technique for achieving cooked grains that do not adhere to each other.</p>
    <p>At the time of the Abbasid Caliphate, such methods of cooking rice at first spread through a vast territory from India to Spain, and eventually to a wider world. The Spanish paella, and the South Asian pilau or pulao, and biryani, evolved from such dishes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 kg long grain rice</li>
        <li>1 kg lamb</li>
        <li>1 kg carrots</li>
        <li>300 ml vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 small onions</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse rice for Uzbek pilaf in a cauldron with cold water, changing it several times.</li>
        <li>Wash lamb for pilaf and cut into cubes. Peel 3 onions and all carrots.</li>
        <li>Put the chopped onion into the cauldron and, stirring, fry until dark golden brown for 5-7 minutes</li>
        <li> Add chopped lamb to the onion.</li>
        <li>Stirring with a spatula, fry the zirvak ingredients until brown and golden brown. This may take about 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Put the cauldron to the meat with onion carrots. Fry without stirring for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Put the rice on the pilaf zirvak in an even layer, increase the heat to the maximum and pour boiling water through the slotted spoon into the cauldron so that it covers the rice with a layer of 3 cm.</li>
        <li>Once all the water has been absorbed, press the garlic cloves into the rice (up to half). Reduce the heat to medium and cook until the pilaf is cooked under the lid.</li>
        <li>Level the surface, cover the Uzbek pilaf with a large flat plate, and top with a lid. Reduce the heat to a minimum and leave the pilaf on fire for 30 minutes.</li>
